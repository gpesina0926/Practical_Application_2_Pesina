Report focuses on a group of used car dealers interested in fine-tuning their inventory.


Business Understanding: Objective: Understand the key factors that influence the price of used cars to help a dealership optimize their inventory and pricing strategies. Focus: Identify what consumers value most in a used car to make informed decisions.

Understanding Data Dataset: The dataset contains 426,000 used cars with various attributes like car age, mileage, brand, model, and price. Exploration: I explored the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of data and the relationships between variables.

Data Prearation: Data Cleaning: I removed missing values and filtered out irrelevant or unrealistic data (e.g., zero or negative prices). Feature Engineering: I created new features like car_age to better capture the factors influencing car prices. Selection of Numeric Data: For correlation analysis, we selected only numeric columns to ensure accurate calculations.

Modeling: Model Selection: I used multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso) to predict car prices. Evaluation: I evaluated models using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared, and conducted hyperparameter tuning for Ridge andso models.

Evaluation: Model Performance: I assessed the performance of the models to determine which one best predicts car prices. Interpretation: I analyzed model coefficients to understand the impact of different feates on car prices.
